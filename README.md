## 🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building a Wayland compositor, including:
- Wayland protocol implementation
- Memory management in C
- Event-driven programming
- Graphics system architecture

## 🚀 Features

- Basic Wayland compositor functionality
- SHM (Shared Memory) buffer support
- Output management
- Surface creation and management
- Secure memory handling
- Comprehensive error handling

## 📋 Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Linux-based operating system
- Wayland development libraries
- GCC compiler
- pkg-config
- Make

### Dependencies
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libwayland-dev wayland-protocols pkg-config build-essential

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install wayland-devel wayland-protocols-devel pkgconfig gcc make

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S wayland wayland-protocols pkgconfig gcc make
```

## 🔧 Building

### Quick Build
```bash
make
```

### Development Build (with debug symbols)
```bash
make debug
```

### Clean Build
```bash
make clean
```

## 🏃 Running

```bash
# Run the compositor
./cwc

# Run with custom socket name
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=cwc-1 ./cwc

# Run with logging
./cwc --log-file /tmp/cwc.log
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run basic tests
make test

# Run with Valgrind for memory leak detection
make valgrind
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to create wayland display"**
   - Ensure you have proper permissions
   - Check if another compositor is running

2. **Missing wayland-server.h**
   - Install wayland development packages
   - Verify pkg-config can find wayland-server

3. **Permission denied on socket**
   - Check XDG_RUNTIME_DIR permissions
   - Ensure the directory exists and is writable

### Debug Mode

Run with debug output:
```bash
CWC_DEBUG=1 ./cwc
```

## 📊 Performance

- Memory usage: ~2MB baseline
- CPU usage: <1% idle
- Supports up to 100 concurrent clients (configurable)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Hardware acceleration support
- [ ] Multi-monitor support
- [ ] Input device handling
- [ ] Window decorations
- [ ] Configuration file support
- [ ] Plugin system
